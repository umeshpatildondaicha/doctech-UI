# @lk/core Library

Core library for Shree Clinic Management System. Provides authentication, shared services, utilities, and the CoreEventService for cross-library communication using Angular Signals.

## Installation

This library is distributed as a `.tgz` file. Install it in your project:

```bash
npm install file:common-libs/core.tgz
```

Or add to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@lk/core": "file:common-libs/core.tgz"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### CoreEventService

The CoreEventService provides a signal-based event bus for cross-library communication:

```typescript
import { Component, inject, computed } from '@angular/core';
import { CoreEventService } from '@lk/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <div>Current Menu: {{ menu() }}</div>
    <button (click)="setMenu('dashboard')">Open Dashboard</button>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  private eventService = inject(CoreEventService);
  
  menu = computed(() => this.eventService.menu());
  
  setMenu(menu: string) {
    this.eventService.setMenu(menu);
  }
}
```

### AuthService

```typescript
import { AuthService } from '@lk/core';

// Inject and use
constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

login() {
  this.authService.login({ email, password }).subscribe(...);
}
```

## Building

To build this library:

```bash
ng build core --configuration=production
```

To pack as `.tgz`:

```bash
cd dist/projects/core
npm pack
mv core-*.tgz ../../../common-libs-archives/core.tgz
```

## Exports

All public APIs are exported from `src/public-api.ts`. See that file for the complete list of available exports.

### Tools/Components

The core library also exports all tool components (buttons, inputs, grids, dialogs, etc.) that can be used across the application:

```typescript
import { 
  AppButtonComponent, 
  AppInputComponent, 
  GridComponent, 
  DialogboxComponent,
  IconComponent 
} from '@lk/core';
```
